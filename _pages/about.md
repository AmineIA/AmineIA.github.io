Welcome to my personal website! It's Amine here
I have completed a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence, following my engineering degree in Data Science at Ecole Centrale Casablanca and an Erasmus exchange at Ecole Centrale Marseille.

In addition to my studies, I have gained valuable experience as an intern in Deep Learning at the Laboratoire d’informatique et systèmes in Marseille, where I optimized advanced models like Mask RCNN. I also served as an AI engineer intern at CTC - Centre Technique du Cuir in Lyon, working on projects for companies such as Hermès and Chanel.

I am passionate about innovation and have worked on various AI projects, including a legal assistance chatbot and optimization of marketing campaigns using machine learning. My technical skills encompass Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.

Beyond my professional interests, I am actively involved in extracurricular activities. I served as the president of the student council at Centrale Casablanca and am a member of the administrative council. My hobbies include music production and football.

Feel free to explore my website to discover my projects, accomplishments, and learn more about me.
